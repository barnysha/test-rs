## About Myself:
I have an economic education. However, working in sales, I always dreamed of becoming a programmer. 
The Code attracted me  and the lack of time for training stopped me. Now it's enough.
I am diligent and like to learn, but I need a mentor to guide me and tell me how to code in real life.


## Skills and Proficiency:

* HTML5, CSS3
* JavaScript Basics
* Git, GitHub
* VS Code, Sublime
* FIGMA


## Code example:

``` 
let usersByDay = [4, 2, 1, 3];
console.log(usersByDay);

let currentIndex = 0;
let minValue = usersByDay[currentIndex];


for (let j = currentIndex + 1; j <= usersByDay.length - 1; j++) {
  if(usersByDay[j]<minValue) {
    minValue = usersByDay[j];
    console.log('New min element: ' + minValue)
    }
}

console.log('Min element: ' + minValue)

```
